## Description
The Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Aggregation project is designed to automate the process of finding and collecting relevant content from the web. The program utilizes Python and various libraries such as Requests, BeautifulSoup, and HuggingFace to scrape web content based on user-defined search queries, extract relevant information, parse and format the content, aggregate it based on user-specified criteria, and continuously update the content collection. It also includes error handling mechanisms and can be deployed autonomously on a cloud server or other computing platforms.

## Business Plan
The Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Aggregation project can be utilized by individuals, businesses, or organizations that require a continuous supply of relevant and up-to-date content from the web. This can include content creators, researchers, data analysts, journalists, and marketers who rely on web content for various purposes such as writing articles, conducting market research, or staying updated on industry trends.

**Target Audience:**
- Content creators: Writers, bloggers, journalists, and researchers who need a regular supply of relevant content.
- Data analysts: Analysts who require web data for market research, trend analysis, or data-driven decisions.
- Marketers: Marketers who need to gather competitive intelligence, identify industry trends, or curate content for social media platforms.
- Researchers: Researchers who rely on web content for academic research, literature reviews, or data collection.
- News organizations: News agencies and media companies that need to automate the process of collecting news articles from various sources.
- E-commerce platforms: Online stores that require product information and reviews from external websites.

**Key Features:**
1. **Search Query Analysis:** The program analyzes user-defined search queries to identify relevant URLs from popular search engines such as Google or Bing.
2. **URL Scrape and Content Extraction:** Using the obtained URLs from search results, the program leverages BeautifulSoup to scrape the web page's content and extracts required information such as article titles, text, images, and metadata.
3. **Automatic Content Parsing and Formatting:** The program automatically parses the extracted content and formats it into a coherent structure. It can leverage HuggingFace small models and natural language processing techniques to enhance accuracy.
4. **Content Aggregation and Categorization:** The program aggregates the extracted content, categorizing it based on topic, source, or any other user-specified criteria. It creates organized collections of articles, blog posts, or any other content type for easy access and navigation.
5. **Continuous Content Updating:** The program periodically re-scans the web using the initial search queries to find new and updated content. It automatically detects and downloads the latest articles and posts, keeping the content collection up-to-date and relevant.
6. **Intelligent Caching and Resource Management:** The program employs an intelligent caching mechanism to optimize performance and minimize unnecessary requests. It stores previously scraped content and only requests new content when necessary.
7. **Error Handling and Failsafes:** The program is equipped with appropriate error handling mechanisms and failsafes. It recognizes and handles errors such as connection issues, incomplete web pages, or content parsing difficulties to ensure smooth operation.
8. **Autonomous Deployment and Monetization:** The program can be deployed on a cloud server or other autonomous computing platforms to operate continuously without human intervention. It can be monetized through various strategies such as displaying contextual advertisements, sponsored content, or affiliate marketing.

**Benefits:**
- Time and Effort Savings: The program automates the process of finding and collecting web content, saving users considerable time and effort compared to manual searching and gathering.
- Accurate and Relevant Content: Leveraging natural language processing techniques and intelligent caching, the program ensures that the extracted content is accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the users' needs.
- Enhanced Content Organization: The program categorizes and organizes the extracted content, making it easier for users to access and navigate the collected information.
- Continuous Updates: With the ability to periodically scan the web for new and updated content, the program ensures that users always have access to the latest information.
- Error Handling: The program includes error handling mechanisms to mitigate potential issues and maintain smooth operation even in the face of connection problems or content parsing difficulties.

## Installation
To run the Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Aggregation program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd repository
```
4. Install the required dependencies by running:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. You're all set! You can now run the program using the following command:
```shell
python main.py
```

## Usage
To use the Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Aggregation program, follow these steps:

1. Define your search queries: Modify the `search_queries` list in the `handle_errors` function of the `ErrorHandling` class to include the desired search queries as strings. For example:
```python
search_queries = ["Autonomous vehicles", "Artificial intelligence"]
```
2. Execute the program: Run the program by executing the `handle_errors` function within the `ErrorHandling` class. This will trigger the execution of the Autonomous Web Scraping and Content Aggregation program, which will scrape web content, extract relevant information, parse and format the content, aggregate it, and continuously update the content collection based on the specified search queries.
